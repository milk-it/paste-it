=== Installing Development Version

Set the protected/runtime and assets directories as writable by the
web server (apache?).

If you downloaded the SVN development version, you will have to
download the PRADO Framework:

www.pradosoft.com or http://www.pradosoft.com/download/prado-latest.tar.gz

* Using PRADO Framework in Shared mode

To use PRADO Framework in shared mode (one prado for many apps) you
just have to set the pradoLocation variable on the config.ini.

* Using PRADO Framework in static mode

To use PRADO Framework in static mode (one prado instance for paste
only) you just have to copy the "framework" dir to the paste-it folder
and comment the pradoLocation variable. This will make paste-it look
for the framework in $PASTE_DIR/framework.

=== Installing Static Package Version

Just extract the paste-it.XXX.tar.gz to a web accessible folder and set
the protected/runtime and assets directories as writable by the
web server (apache?).

=== Setting up the .htaccess file

Set the RewriteBase variable in the .htaccess file as exemplified below:

e.g.: hosting paste-it on www.example.com/paste
RewriteBase /paste

eg.: hosting paste-it on www.example.com/path/to/paste
RewriteBase /path/to/paste

eg.: hosting paste-it on paste.example.com
RewriteBase /

=== Configuring database

 * Create a new database (maybe pasteit, or paste, or anything you wants...).
 * Run the database.sql against the new database.
 * Configure the database in the config.ini file.

You're now ready to go!
