PHP Code Pastebin
=================

This tool was orignally designed to enable collaborative code review via 
the #php IRC channel. Inspired by www.parseerror.com/paste, but more 
streamlined and capable of allowing collabation via IRC by allowing easy 
modification of posted code. Another benefit is short urls - e.g. 
http://pastebin.com/333

Since then it has found uses in many developer communities and has been
constantly improved.

The latest version of this code can always be found at http://pastebin.com

News about updates will be made on my blog http://blog.dixo.net

If you have any fixes or feature suggestions, please get in touch.
